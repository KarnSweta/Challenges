# Challenges

Challenge1:<br>
A 3-tier environment is a common setup. Use a tool of your choosing/familiarity create these resources on a cloud environment (Azure/AWS/GCP).<br>
<br>
Challenge2:<br>
We need to write code that will query the meta data of an instance within AWS or Azure or GCP and provide a json formatted output.<br>
Bonus Points<br>
The code allows for a particular data key to be retrieved individually.<br>
<br>
Challenge3:<br>
We have a nested object. We would like a function where you pass in the object and a key and get back the value.<br>
The choice of language and implementation is up to you.<br>
Example Inputs<br>
object = {“a”:{“b”:{“c”:”d”}}}<br>
key = a/b/c<br>
object = {“x”:{“y”:{“z”:”a”}}}<br>
key = x/y/z<br>
value = a<br>
